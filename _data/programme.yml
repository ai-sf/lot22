info: " <p> The Lights of Tuscany programme is coming to its third edition. Following last years' great success, the Italian Association of Physics Students (AISF) will be organising it once more, also including some new features and further improvements.</p>
<p>
During the Programme, 40 students will be visiting the European Laboratory for Nonlinear Spectroscopy, the VIRGO site of the European Gravitational Observatory and the facilities at the INFN, University of Pisa and University of Firenze in central Italy. The event will have a focus on Photonics, but a number of other topics will be touched upon, including Matter physics, Quantum Optics, Biophysics. Students will be expected to have a basic understanding of these subjects in order to effectively make the most of the programme.
